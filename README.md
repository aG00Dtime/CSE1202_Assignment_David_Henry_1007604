# CSE1202_Assignment_David_Henry_1007604_very_cringe

Using the Python programming language, you are required to build an application that demonstrates creative
programmatic engagement with ONE of the following topic areas:

1.  Number Theory
2.  Trigonometry
3.  Linear Algebra
4.  Calculus

Your application must use the concepts associated with the chosen topic area to implement your ‘creative’ idea. While
you are not limited to these examples, you may opt to build a game, simulation or an innovative tool to solve a problem.
To do well in this assignment, your use of the concepts should be integrated with your programme at the ‘application’
level. So, for example, a ‘Maths and Stats Calculator’ would not score as highly as a program that more artfully uses the
concepts to implement features in a game, simulation or tool.
